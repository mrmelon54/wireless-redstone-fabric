For v2.0.2 onwards Cardinal Components is embedded and doesn't need to be downloaded separately

## Setup

- Drop the mod in the mods folder

## Details

My version of a simple wireless redstone transmitter and receiver.

The crafting recipes are in the images tab/folder.

## Usage

Right click on transmitter or receiver blocks to change the frequency and allow multiple wireless connections at the same time.

## Handheld

From v3.0.0 there is a handheld device that players can use to trigger receivers on the same frequency.

Right-click the handheld to toggle on/off state. The state remains even if the handheld is put in a chest or if the player holding it logs off.

To change the frequency hold shift + right click to open the frequency changing screen.
